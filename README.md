## Project Overview

- WriteRight is a web application that transforms your webcam into an interactive writing tool that tracks and traces your index finger movements in realtime
- The app offers kanji character template overlays so that users can trace to learn and receive immediate visual feedback whcih llows students to focus on the flow and structure of characters rather than managing writing tools.

## Features

- **Webcam Capture**: Uses the webcam to track hand movements as the user writes.
- **Hand Motion Tracking**: Real-time tracking of hand gestures using Google’s Mediapipe API.
- **OCR Comparison**: Analyzes the drawn Kanji and compares it with a correct version of the character.
- **Accuracy Scoring**: Provides users with a score based on the accuracy of their strokes and character order.
- **Multiple Modes**: Practice different aspects of Kanji, such as stroke order and pronunciation.
- **Progress Tracking**: Save your progress and revisit past attempts to monitor improvement.
